Welcome to glypy's documentation!
==================================

Glycobiology is the study of the biological functions, properties, and structures of carbohydrate biomolecules,
also called *glycans*. These large, tree-like molecules are complex, having a wide variety of building blocks
as well as modifications and substitutions on those building blocks.

Much in the same way other bioinformatics libraries provide ways to represent DNA, RNA, or Protein sequences,
this library attempts to provide a representation of glycans. Much of the variation found in the
building blocks of these structures, monosaccharides, are caused by substitutions of functional groups on a
common core structure.
